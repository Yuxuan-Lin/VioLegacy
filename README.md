# VioLegacy

A web app

## Setup

In one shell:
- Copy the files to a directory ad move into the directory (e.g. `git clone https://github.com/Yuxuan-Lin/VioLegacy.git && cd VioLegacy`)
- Install dependencies with `npm i`
- Set up server with `node API/Test.js`

## Run website

In another shell:
- Move into directory again (`cd VioLegacy`)
- Start website `npm start`

I am the best.
